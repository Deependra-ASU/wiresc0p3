## Honeypot

A honeypot is defense by deception. It is a program intended to simulate common network services, pretending to be “low hanging fruit” on a network.

## Usage

Run Honeypot.py as a python script (may require to be a super-user), passing as argument the Port to listen to.

Example:

`python3 honeypot.py port_no`

`Sudo python3 honeypot.py port_no`
